This version is on the way to accomplish a second layer comment feature.
Post is the 0th layer, first comment section is the 1 layer, you know, as a programmer you need to start counting everything with 0 as a start.

Your pattern to name things should be "2nd-layer-comment-btn"..

I separate the folders to be api and nth-layer-comment
This helps me to differentiate the new features and the essential features apart.
